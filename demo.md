# Lucas CLI TUI Demo

The new Lucas CLI TUI has been successfully implemented with the Device abstraction layer integration.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Screen Interface
- **Device Setup Screen**: Configure device connection
- **Connected Screen**: Main menu when connected to device  
- **Action Input Screen**: Interactive action execution
- **Action History Screen**: View past actions and responses

### 2. Device Connection Flow
1. Select device type (currently "Sony Bravia TV")
2. Enter host address (IP:port format with validation)
3. Enter credential (PSK, displayed as masked input)
4. Test connection and validate

### 3. Interactive Action Execution
- Select action type: "remote" or "control"
- Choose from available actions based on type
- Input JSON parameters for actions that require them
- Execute actions and view formatted responses
- Real-time feedback and error handling

### 4. Action Management
- Action history with timestamps and success/failure status
- Response data formatting and display
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Usage Example

```bash
# Start the interactive TUI
./bazel-bin/lucas_/lucas cli

# The TUI will guide you through:
# 1. Device setup (device type, host, credential)
# 2. Connection testing and validation  
# 3. Action selection and execution
# 4. Response viewing and history
```

## Key Features

### Input Validation
- Host address format validation (IP:port)
- JSON parameter parsing and validation
- Real-time error feedback

### Navigation
- Tab navigation between fields
- Arrow key navigation for selections
- Keyboard shortcuts (q to go back, Ctrl+C to quit)
- Number keys for quick menu selection

### Visual Design
- Clean, modern terminal UI with colors
- Focused field highlighting
- Status indicators (success/error)
- Code formatting for JSON responses

### Device Integration
- Full integration with Device interface and BraviaRemote
- Automatic action routing based on type
- Parameter handling for complex actions
- Response parsing and display

## Available Actions

### Remote Actions
- power, power_on, power_off
- volume_up, volume_down, mute  
- channel_up, channel_down
- navigation: up, down, left, right, confirm
- home, menu, back, input
